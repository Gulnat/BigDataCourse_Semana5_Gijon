File M5_01 : Python / Intro - Theory on lists, operators, types of data, functions, dictionaries, strings. Functions Maps, Filter and Reduce.
## File M5_01 Python :

- Theory on lists, operators, types of data, functions, dictionaries, strings.
- Functions Maps, Filter and Reduce.
  
## File M5_02 Conditions :

- Practicing applying the IF structure.
- Examples with Tree diagram (Super heroes), Loop year and Palindrom.
 
## File M5_03 Bucles/Loops :

- Theory and practice on the usage of loops FOR and WHILE.
- Iterations.
- Ex on counting the number of vocals in the string. Generate number sequencies, nested loops, use of Range. 

## File SpaceX :

- Import libraries
- Function for creating empty lists: LaunchSite, PayLoads and CoreData
- Append()
- Head()
- Filter dataframe, condition

In this practice you will obtain the data to predict if a Falcon 9 will land successfully or not.

## File Introduction a Machine Learning / SciKit Learn :

- !pip install scikit-learn - import SciKit 
- Ej1 of Supervised Learning: X-Train. X-Test, Y-Train, Y-Test - 20/80 notion
- Assigning instances for testing
- Fit() - for training the model
- Predict() - after training its ready to make prediction
- Lineplot(), Scatterplot() - build a graph for prediction 
- Ej2 - using LinearRegression model
- StandardScaler - normalization of values, build 2 graphs to compare original and normalised values
- Ej3 - problem of overfitting, as using 100% of testing data instead of 80%
- Ej4 - GridSearch CV - Cross Validation. Repite many times and choose the best in terms of best parametres of m and n.

## Predecir el valor de Bitcoin :

- Prophet - library for predicting timeseries
- !python -m pip - install prophet
- Download BTC (Bitcoin) timeseries from Yahoo Finance
- btc_df.isnull().sum() - valifate nulls
- Use only 2 columns "Date" and "Open" and rename them into "Ds" and "Y"
- Build a graph on all data
- Assign instance, train model with fit()
- Make_future_dataframe(x) - method of Prophet for making a prediction

In this practice you will obtain the data to predict if a Falcon 9 will land successfully or not.

## Folium  : NB!!! TO Do

- Import libraries
- Function for creating empty lists: LaunchSite, PayLoads and CoreData
- Append()
- Head()
- Filter dataframe, condition

In this practice you will obtain the data to predict if a Falcon 9 will land successfully or not.
